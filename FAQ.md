# Frequently Asked Questions

[README](README.md) before reading FAQ.

## Why not xyz chip?

Our requirement for microcontroller is as follows:

- high processing power
- 8000Hz polling rate support
- active Rust ecosystem
- high enough usable ADC channels
- low price

## What component do you use?

Open the [PCB](./pcb) project in KiCad and double-click on a component.

## Why 2 layer PCB?

Because a 4-layer PCB is already 50% more expensive than 2-layer PCB and the
price only goes up from there.

## Why not TMR?

TMR sensors ...

- are WAY more expensive than hall effect sensors
- have narrower magnetic range
- are harder to source components
